1. I am a second-year student at GrSU.Yanka Kupala, majoring in computer physics. My goal is to deepen my knowledge of programming as much as possible, as the university provides a superficial base, and I believe that rs school will help me achieve this. I am responsible, ambitious, and always finish what I start. I hope to complete all the stages of this course and find a job as a developer.
 2. Skills: 
    * HTML
    * CSS
    * C#
    * JS
 3. Code examle
    ```
    const assert = require("chai").assert;

    describe("Multiply", () => {
      it("fixed tests", () => {
    assert.strictEqual(multiply(1,1), 1);
    assert.strictEqual(multiply(2,1), 2);
    assert.strictEqual(multiply(2,2), 4);
    assert.strictEqual(multiply(3,5), 15); 
    assert.strictEqual(multiply(5,0), 0);
    assert.strictEqual(multiply(0,5), 0);
    assert.strictEqual(multiply(0,0), 0); 
      });
    });
    ```

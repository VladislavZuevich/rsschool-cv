1. I am a second-year student at GrSU.Yanka Kupala, majoring in computer physics. My goal is to deepen my knowledge of programming as much as possible, as the university provides a superficial base, and I believe that rs school will help me achieve this. I am responsible, ambitious, and always finish what I start. I hope to complete all the stages of this course and find a job as a developer.

    * HTML
    * CSS
    * C#

    assert.strictEqual(isPangram(string), true)
  })
  it("test2", () => {
